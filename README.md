# 📧 Spam Email Classifier

This is a small project I built to classify messages as *Spam* or *Not Spam*.  
I created this project to understand how basic *NLP (Natural Language Processing)* and *machine learning models* work for text classification.

## 📂 Project Contents

- *spam.csv* — Dataset used for training  
- *spam_classifier.ipynb* — Jupyter notebook for data preprocessing and model training  
- *vectorizer.pkl* — Saved TF-IDF vectorizer  
- *spam_model.pkl* — Trained machine learning model  
- *app.py* — Streamlit app  
- *requirements.txt* — Dependencies

## 🧠 How It Works

1. The user enters a message in the web app.  
2. The message is converted into TF-IDF vectors using vectorizer.pkl.  
3. The trained model (spam_model.pkl) predicts whether the message is *Spam* or *Not Spam*.  
4. The result is displayed instantly on the screen.

## 🎯 Purpose of This Project

This project was built mainly for:

- Learning and practicing NLP preprocessing  
- Understanding machine learning model training  
- Deploying a model as a web app using *Streamlit Cloud*

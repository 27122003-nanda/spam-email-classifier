# Spam Email Classifier

This is a small project I built to classify messages as *Spam* or *Not Spam*.  
I created this project to understand how basic NLP (Natural Language Processing) and machine learning models work for text classification.

## 📦 Project Contents
- spam.csv — Dataset used for training  
- spam_classifier.ipynb — Jupyter notebook for data preprocessing and model training  
- vectorizer.pkl — Saved TF-IDF vectorizer  
- spam_model.pkl — Trained machine learning model  
- app.py — Streamlit app  
- requirements.txt — Dependencies

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python  
- Pandas  
- Scikit-learn  
- Streamlit  
- Pickle

## 🚀 How It Works
1. User enters a message in the app  
2. Message is converted into numerical form with the vectorizer  
3. Trained model predicts *Spam* or *Not Spam*  
4. Result is displayed instantly
